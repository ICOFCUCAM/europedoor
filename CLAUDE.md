# Europedoor — working notes

A static site: 508 generated HTML files, no dependencies, no database. Every
page comes from `data/` via `tools/build.py`. Nothing in `site/` was written
by a human and nothing ever should be.

**The name is Europedoor, at europedoor.com. It does not change.** Strategy
documents keep arriving with alternatives on them — Europe Atlas, Europia,
Via Europa. Take their architecture and drop their branding section. See
`docs/brand-lock.md`; `tools/checks.py` enforces it.

## Read these first, depending on the work

| doing | read |
|---|---|
| **anything substantial — start here** | **`docs/product-specification.md`** — the 36-section brief answered, plus the Postgres schema, the API, the AI pipeline with actual prompts, the dashboards, the money and the risks. Four marked DEVIATIONs from the brief, each with its reasoning |
| changing how pages are generated | **`docs/architecture.md`** — the four rules the build depends on |
| adding or editing a place | **`docs/data-model.md`** — every field, and what the validator rejects |
| the scores | **`docs/scoring-method.md`** — and note the formula is published at `/method`, so changing `score.py` changes a public page |
| anything involving money | **`docs/europe-fund.md`** and **`docs/legal-position.md`** — three gates, all currently shut |
| naming, branding, domains | **`docs/brand-lock.md`** — settled, and enforced |
| what to build next | **`docs/roadmap.md`** |

## The rules that catch people out

**`site/` is deleted on every build.** Editing a generated page is work that
disappears on the next `build.py` with no warning and no failing check. If a
page needs to say something new, it says it in `tools/lib/pages.py` or in
`data/`.

**There is exactly one page shell.** `render.page()` is the only function
that emits `<html>`. Do not add a second, and do not add an inline `<style>`
to a page — `checks.py` fails on both, because a masthead that exists twice
diverges within a month.

**The generated site is committed, and CI fails if it is stale.** After any
change to `data/`, `tools/` or `assets/`, run `python3 tools/build.py` and
commit `site/` in the same commit. A stale `site/` means the checks validated
output nobody is going to serve.

**Advisory countries are stripped from the planner index at build time**, not
hidden in the UI. Ukraine, Russia and Belarus keep a page carrying the
warning and are absent from `/api/atlas.json`. Do not "fix" this by filtering
in JavaScript.

**The Fund holds nothing, and the checks enforce it.** No form, no payment
link, no amount raised, no progress bar on any `/fund` page; no `amount`,
`raised`, `goal` or `target` in `data/fund.json`. This is the single easiest
thing for a well-meaning person to break.

**No photographs.** Every illustration is a deterministic SVG from the hash
of a slug. `checks.py` fails on any `<img>`. This keeps the licensing
position simple and it is not an aesthetic preference.

**No `rank`, `boost`, `featured` or `sponsored` field on a place.**
Sponsorship attaches to a provider and affects directory surfaces only. That
wall is enforced in the schema, which is the only version of the promise
worth making.

## Gates

Run all four before claiming anything is done.

    python3 tools/build.py check       validate the data
    python3 tools/build.py            508 pages
    python3 tools/checks.py            22 checks, ~28,000 things examined
    node tools/browser-checks.js       88 checks in Chromium

The browser checks need `npm install playwright` and take about thirty
seconds. They earn their place: they caught a 47-pixel mobile overflow on
every city page that no amount of reading the CSS would have found. They
launch the sandbox's own Chromium via `executablePath` because the npm
package version will not match the installed browser build.

## Adding a country

1. Write `data/countries/<slug>.json` against `docs/data-model.md`.
2. Add the slug to exactly one macro region in `data/taxonomy.json`.
3. `python3 tools/build.py check` — the validator lists every problem at
   once, so one run fixes one round of mistakes.
4. Build, run both check suites, commit `site/` with the data.

Depth beats breadth. 244 cities written properly beats 40,000 imported, and
there is no importer in this repository on purpose.

## Style

Long comments that explain *why*, usually naming the failure that prompted
the change. Keep them. Prefer recording a mistake to quietly deleting the
evidence of it — the note in `assets/css/europedoor.css` about the 47px
overflow is worth more than the two lines of CSS that fixed it.
